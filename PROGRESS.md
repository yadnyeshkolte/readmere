- **Memory Management**: Initial state saved in Gemini CLI memory.

## Completed Tasks

- [ ] Enhance the UI with more detailed agent logs.

## Agent Context
If you are an AI agent starting a new session:
1. Read this file to understand where we left off.
2. Check `save_memory` for project-wide constants.
3. The goal is to submit this project for the **2 Fast 2 MCP Hackathon** (Ends Feb 15).
